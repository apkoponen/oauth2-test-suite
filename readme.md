# OAuth 2.0 Test Suite

OAuth 2.0 Test Suite is a simple test suite that can be used to test any
OAuth 2.0 authorization server supporting authorization code grant and PHP
based OAuth 2.0 clients that implement the PHP League's
[OAuth 2.0 client's](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client)
AbstractProvider.

The test suite was built for my Master's Thesis
